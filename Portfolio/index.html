    <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

    <p>For as long as they’ve been alive, these few people have been living in a cave, only being able to see one way. Once a day, every few hours, there appears to be a magical being that these people of the cave see.  <span class = "clickable" id="first-change"> The entity moves quickly, up- down- left - right; in almost every direction except towards the people of the cave.</span>
        As this entity does not speak, it communicates with a single loud gruesome noise every time it reaches a halt, then proceeds to move at an incomprehensible speed known to the people. The people think of it as their guard of the cave, to make sure none of them ever move from where they are and dare not venture out into the world as the shadow entity would find them at its light-speed and maul them, a fate worse than death. A hound created from the very people that put them in this cave originally, to make sure they are trapped forever. The horrifying shadow creature tortures them with its howls every night, for dreadful hours taunting the people of the cave, scaring them straight to obedience to the masters of the cave.
        <span class = "clickable" id="second-change"> Then, always at the end of the entity's terror, it disappears towards the sky only to return the next day and the next for the rest of their lives.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>The concept of “Flatness” is a locked perspective that people are unable to break free from. I perceive this concept of flatness as the inability to see the world more than with what you are given. I think of “Flatness” as a landscape where thoughts, concepts and ideas are restricted by a set of rules that are not challenged. 

        “Flatness” does not have to be a bad thing but a step to development and evolution of one’s way of living their life. To know oneself in this type of locked perspective is one of the first ways to break free from the chains set from tradition and social norms. Furthermore, to be able to accept different perspectives and viewpoints in life and allow these things to mold you into a more dynamic, understanding being. “Flatness” encourages a departure from the mindset “it is what it is” into a mindset of understanding “it” and building off of “it” to discover new non-linear viewpoints.
        
        The people of the cave’s worldview is in fact “Flat” as they only see their life in one locked perspective: the cave wall and their vicious shadow entity guard. These cave people accept that the shadow creature is meant to keep them where they are and are scared to look past what information they are initially given. None of the cave people dare to look past their “Flatness” and try to figure out more than what they see.

    <h2>2. Seeing double</h2>

    <p>In a village far long ago, lives a young boy named Garrett. Garrett finds himself lost in the monotonous lifestyle he and his village lives in days which to him stretched on endlessly. One afternoon, while travelling a forest nearby his village, Garrett finds a large oak tree and under its overgrown roots, lies a secret hidden entrance to a large dark cave. With much excitement, Garrett goes home and thinks of all the activities he can do there and has an idea to bring his trusty old rubber ball. The next night, he ventures off to the cave with his torch in hand and a bouncy ball and <span class = "clickable" id="third-change">  proceeds to test out his new found play area</span>
        Now, every night for fun, Garrett runs down to the hidden cave to bounce his ball as the acoustics in this cave make for interesting noises every time the ball bounces. He travels to the cave with his torch and places it on the wall and begins to bounce the ball until he gets tired which usually takes a couple of hours. After he’s finished,
        <span class = "clickable" id="fourth-change"> he bounces the ball once more and catches it, blows out his torch and leaves for his home.

        </span>
    </p>

    <p>The concept of seeing double is being able to know more about something the more perspective or ways you look at it. Two or more perspectives gives us a better understanding of situations or events, and lets someone gain greater knowledge on something. Seeing double prompts us to approach every angle, every concept, and every viewpoint to explore more within life.
        The people of the cave see the cave in their prison with a guard keeping them trapped inside with no chance at escaping. Garrett sees the cave as a fun area to bounce his ball and play games in. 
        
        Seeing these multiple perspectives let us see that the people of the cave were never prisoners to begin with, they are free to leave any time they want. Although, if none of the people break free of the restraints of their own “flatness”, they will never get to see that the entity is just a ball, they will never be free. 
        
            Garrett’s bouncy ball is the “shadow” creature that the people of the cave see every night and what scares them. Garrett does not know that the people of the cave exist as he just comes down to the cave with his torch every night to simply play his own game. The torch that the boy brings casts the shadow creature onto the wall in front of the cave people and the howls that they hear are simply the noise coming from the bouncy ball. Every night that the shadow creature disappears, the boy picks his ball up and blows out his torch.
